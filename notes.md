Sanity Checks: all done with integration stacks of length d+10
- with full leakage (leak = 0)
    - no delay: 100% accuracy over 30 images
    - with binary firing
        - -> 90% accuracy (no delays, no biases)
        - with biases, accuracy drops to 10% (literally guessing); biases lead to preferred guess that is independent of inputs
    - without biases --> same performance
    - With noise
        - With biases, non binary firing
            - 10% Noise: 100% accuracy over 20 images
            - 50% Noise: 65% over 20 images (same for stack of d+10 and d+20)
            - 100% Noise: 25% over 20 images (same for stack of d+10 and d+20)
        - without biases, binary firing
            - 10% Noise: 10% over 20 images (same for stack of d+10 and d+20)
            - 50% Noise: 10% (at random guessing)
- implementing leakage:
    - leak = 0.9
        - noiseless --> 100% accuracy over 20 images
        - 10% noise --> 100% accuracy ""
        - 50% noise --> 65% accuracy over 20
        - 100% noise --> 20% over 20 images
    - leak = 0.1
        - no data yet
